__Feature-rich server software for Minecraft: Pocket Edition__

-------------

Introduction
-------------
Genisys is a server software for Minecraft: Pocket Edition.<br>
It is only a fork of __[PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP)__ and most of the codes are written by **PocketMine Team**.<br>
There are a few difference between Genisys and PocketMine-MP:

* Extra plugin APls (GeniAPI)
* More features and more similar with vanilla MCPE
* Synapse Client support

However, Genisys still has a long way to go. We welcome contributions.
